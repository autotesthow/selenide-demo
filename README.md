### To reuse the code from this project

Ensure you installed everything from the Prerequisites section and additionally install:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Open your unix terminal (or at least git bash on Windows) and execute the following commands(just copy&paste everything into the terminal and press Enter):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:autotesthow/selenide-demo.git selenide-demo \
&& cd $_ 
```

Open the project in the Intellij Idea. Check the code in src/main/java/org/example/Main.java and run it by pressing context click on the file and selecting «Run Main.main()»

Enjoy the result!

P.S.
You may find that your google search results are different from the ones in the video. This is because Google is constantly changing its search algorithm. So, if you see different results or different amount of results, and your test fails, it's not the problem. Let it be your task to adjust the code to make it work again;)
